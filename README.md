# electron react seed

This is boilerplate for any electron react projects.

It is based on [https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate). 

But some thigs are simplified.
This one is as simple as possible to fulfill my needs. If you need something more feature rich, you should go with original one.
